Control Modes

Passive mimic
Follow P = .00215 * n * n2^2
Solve for power to determine resitor array command
value of n is set by rotary encoder or buttons

Speed Control
Use encoder to set target value for n2
Adjust load to stabilize speed

Power Control
Use rotary encoder to set desired power level. This utilizes fine resolution of encoder and  dimmer


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resistive Loads
AC SSR commands set by lookup table corresponding to levels.

Finer resolution determined by:

PWM Approach
select pwm level by finding value in between stage

Lightbulb Load
Utilize same logic as larger load bank... Need to use gpio breakout board
